## Background Subtraction Methods in OpenCV

This repository demonstrates multiple background subtraction techniques using **OpenCV**, commonly used for motion detection, object tracking, and video analysis.

### ðŸŒŸ Implemented Methods:
1. **MOG (Mixture of Gaussians)** â€“ A classic background subtraction algorithm.
2. **MOG2 (Improved Mixture of Gaussians)** â€“ An adaptive version of MOG that detects shadows.
3. **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** â€“ Uses a distance-based approach to separate the foreground from the background.
4. **Frame Differencing** â€“ Compares consecutive frames to detect motion.
5. **Running Average Background Subtraction** â€“ Maintains an averaged background model.
